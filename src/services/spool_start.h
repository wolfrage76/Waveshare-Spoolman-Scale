//  WHAT A SPOOL CREATED OFF THE PAD STARTS WITH
//
//  Read off the pad once, when a spool is created: the full weight to file,
//  what is left on it, and a word on how the reading was taken. Pure
//  arithmetic, no backend. The tag card, the database pick and the copy flow
//  all go through it, so one rule decides for all three.
//
//  The rule (decided 24.10.2026): the empty spool is the trustworthy number
//  and the filament is measured against it. A full spool whose empty weight
//  someone stored (on the filament, the brand, a catalog entry, the copy's
//  template) files its measured net as its full weight - the label is what
//  the maker promised, the pad says what is there. A full spool on Bambu's
//  fixed 250 g core keeps the label as its full weight: the real cores vary
//  by 11 g, as much as the fill the measurement is after. The measured net is
//  filed as what is left either way. Nothing on the pad, or more than a full
//  spool can weigh, files the label as full and says so.

// How far an empty spool weight is to be trusted. `fixed_default` says the
// tag brought a maker's fixed figure of `default_g`; a stored weight that
// says exactly that figure is that figure and nothing more. The scale itself
// files the 250 g core on the brand and the filament it creates, so from the
// second Bambu spool on the entry would otherwise pass as a measurement.
