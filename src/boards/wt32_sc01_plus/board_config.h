// The PN532's reset line exists in two places, and which one is used is a
// property of the device rather than of the firmware.
//
// Every SpoolmanScale built before September 2026 has the orange RST wire on
// the header opposite the labelled one, where the module brings out an output
// rather than its RSTPD_N input. Measured on the bench: with the wire there,
// holding any connector GPIO low leaves the reader answering
// GetFirmwareVersion with a healthy 0x32010607 - the reset simply never
// reached the chip, on any unit, since May 2026.
//
// Moving the wire to RSTPDN makes it work; verified on 2026-08-29, where the
// same probe returned SILENT while held and the reader came back after. But
// that is a soldering job, most of the fleet will never do it, and driving
// PN532_RESET_WIRE on a device that still has the old wiring puts the ESP32's
// output against the module's. So the pin is only handed to the library after
// a measurement on this very device says the wire was moved - see
// services/nfc_reset.h.

constexpr int8_t PN532_RESET_SAFE = 12;   // EXT_IO3, pin 5, no build ever wired it

// The PN532's IRQ line is not wired, and in I2C mode the library never reads
// it: isready() answers from the bus, and the branch that would call
// digitalRead(_irq) sits behind that check and is unreachable. Its constructor
// still calls pinMode() on whatever pin number it is handed though, and -1
// arrives there as 255, which logs "Invalid pin selected" on every single boot.
// That line reads like a fault and is not one, so the constructor gets a pin
// that exists and costs nothing: EXT_IO4 on the extension connector, unused by
// this firmware and an input after reset anyway.
